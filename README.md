# solar

A command-line interface for transpiling text source files to Scratch 3.0 projects.

There are some beneficial features in this language which aren't present in Scratch:
- Functions that can return
- Local variables
- Runtime allocation

## Goals
This application can help with creating more complex programs in Scratch. However, a downside is that
there is no visual IDE, so positioning sprites and costumes and such will be harder.
I consider a visual IDE to be some sort of a stretch goal.

It might be more preferable to create sprite3 files which contain mostly code, and then
patching together the output with an existing Scratch project.
